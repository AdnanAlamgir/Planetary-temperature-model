# Planetary-temperature-model
The planetary temperature model of tidally locked planets I made as part of my research work in the Lumiere research program. This model incorporates different planetary factors to determine the habitability of any such planet. Starting as very fundamental, hope to build up on this.
First I used basic temperature equilibrium equations to set up the equation to calculate the surface and atmospheric temperatures of the planet. Then I included 3 factors: oceanic heat transport, atmospheric heat transport, cloud and albedo. 
 
Future plans include but are not restricted to: introducing obliquity as a factor, express atmospheric and surface parameters in terms of planetary features, and lastly train it to be a fullproof model.
